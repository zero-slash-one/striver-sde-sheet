# Set Matrix Zero
Problem Statement: Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix.

Examples
Examples 1:

Input: matrix=[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]

Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

Explanation: Since matrix[2][2]=0.Therfore the 2nd column and 2nd row wil be set to 0.
 
Input: matrix=[[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]

Output:[[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]

Explanation:Since matrix[0][0]=0 and matrix[0][3]=0. Therefore 1st row, 1st column and 4th column will be set to 0
